Movie Match - A MERN stack web application
A website for finding movies, based on your favorite genres and streaming platforms! Also a place to store YOUR favorite movies and remember how much you enjoyed them (or didn't).

1. Clone the directory
2. git clone https://github.com/sulagnamoh/movie-match.git
3. Setup/installations to run the build; run these commands in your Terminal that is inside the movie-match directory
   - npm install (will install everything to start both the frontend and backend)
   - nodemon App.js (connects to the database - server runs on port 3000)
   - split the terminal
   - npm start (keep 'nodemon App.js' running in a different terminal tab when running this command)

Nodemon Troubleshooting: If you have troubles running nodemon App.js, run the command "sudo npm install nodemon -g"

Network Troubleshooting: The user should be prompted with "Connected to MongoDB" in the seperate nodemon App.js terminal. If the user struggles to connect to the MongoDB database, try again after changing your network.

The backend server runs on port 3000
The frontend development runs on [http://localhost:3001] in your browser
